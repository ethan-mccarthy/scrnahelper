# scrnahelper
I've written a few functions that help me look through scRNA-seq data while working with Seurat!

## How to install
The easiest way to install the scrnahelper package is using the devtools package (which you can install using the following):
```
install.packages("devtools") # Installs devtools from CRAN
```

Once you have devtools installed, run the following in the R console:
```
devtools::::install_github("ethan-mccarthy/scrnahelper")
```

## Using scrnahelper
When you want to use a function from scrnahelper, you'll need to let R know by running the following line:
```
library(scrnahelper)
```
